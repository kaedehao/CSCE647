            Rendering polygon meshes are far more fun than planes and quadratics, but also more challenging. I need to include
            K-D tree to achieve reasonable performance, even with GPU implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            All images below are rendered with <b>1024 shadow rays per pixel</b> to generate soft shadow, since I simply could not bear to look at
            hard shadow images anymore :/. The rendering a while, but the images are definitely worth the waiting.
            In fact, most of the images below can be generated in <b>real time</b> if rendered with fewer shadow rays (special thanks
            to my Nvidia GTX-750 GPU).
        </p>
        <p>
            The K-D tree I implemented now is probably a low quality one, since I used the primitive median separation method.
        Adding surface area heuristic for the construction of K-D tree should produce much better trees and further boost
        the rendering performance.
        </p>

            The source code of this project is available <a href="https://github.com/phg1024/CSCE647/tree/master/sourcecode/CUDARayTracer/CUDARayTracer">here</a>.
            It is a bit messy currently, but I will try to clean it up later.
